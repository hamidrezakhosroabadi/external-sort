# Merge Sort for Large Files

This is a Python code for sorting large files that are too large to fit into memory using the merge sort algorithm. The code reads the input file, splits it into smaller chunks, sorts them and creates temporary files for each sorted chunk. Then, it merges the temporary files together to form a single sorted output file.
Requirements

This code requires Python 3.x to be installed on your system.
Usage

To use the code, follow these steps:

    Place the file you want to sort in the same directory as the script.
    Open the script in your favorite Python editor and set the file_name variable to the name of the file you want to sort.
    Run the script.

The sorted output will be written to a file called result.txt in the same directory as the script.
